1) Check your color space settings under Edit -> Project Settings -> Player -> Other Settings.
We recommend setting it to Linear when possible.

2) Import the pack that matches your platform (PC or Mobile)

For example, if you are developing a PC project and your color space is Linear, then
"Eternal Temple PC Linear 1.5.unitypackage" is for you.

3) If your color space is Gamma and it is too late to swich to linear, import a linear package first,
and then import one of the "converters to gamma space".

For example, if you are developing a Mobile project in Gamma space, import
"Eternal Temple Mobile Linear 1.5" first, and then import "Convert Mobile Linear to Gamma 1.5"
on top of it.

4) Double click on a pack to import it.
